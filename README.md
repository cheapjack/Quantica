Material Discursive Apparatus for The People
============================================

Let’s not replace design and making with dialogues; making and design *are* the dialogue

### Kits and making are material-discursive apparatus for learning: that's what we need to design with our audiences.

Making is already dialogical; kits, and making and STEM embody prior and
present and future conversations. *Critical* making and *Critical Kits*
pay extra attention to the construction of these dialogues while
maintaining the mobility, convenience and agency of the activity.

Critcal Kits are an *approach* and *sensibility* to kit making:

-   Aid the *construction* of knowledge, rather than *illustrate* or *present*

-   Embody tricky and creative conversations in an accessible way

-   Lead to exploring and generating more questions, or theory making

We don't want to separate talking from doing: but think of a form of
***critical making** as **a design discourse ***or ***conversation.***

### Apparatus are discourses

> “Discourse is not what is said: it is that which constrains and
> enables what can be said.” (Barad)

Physicist and Feminist studies professor Karen Barad reads the work of
Niels Bohr's understandings of the importance of the ‘apparatus’ of an experiment, even the *'gedanken'* thought experiments he and Einstein argued over, and puts forward the idea that:

> "it is not merely the case that human concepts are embodied in
> apparatuses, but rather that apparatuses *are* discursive practices"

It might be useful and relevant with respect to the ethnographic
approaches of many of the artists and also the material play with
apparatus of ***Yunchul Kim*** to think of STEAMY kits as *apparatus* in this way. Not as an analogy to experiment, but as a *practice*.

What we make *embodies* many kinds of *discourse;* of conversations.

So the conversations we make *should* *be situated in* and around
making: just think about the 'better talking' that happens when you are
occupied constructing knowledge together rather than listening or
performing to a stage.

In fact, rather than designing kits or activity for the construction of
a bit of scientific knowledge creatively, ‘Steamy making' is about
designing (but not completely determining) the sort of dialogues people
might make (and we might record).

Working out what those dialogues could be and how we practically &
steam-ily *design* and make them is our focus with our collaborators.

### A Way Forward

I've tried to put together some starting points for how this approach gets realised both for the archive elements and general audience engagement, but equally used in the 23rd Novemeber teacher conference, who more than likely would design more specific to them and their curriculum. The materials would frame and start the design conversations we would have in that setting

## Practical Activity & Kits

These are activities and kits shared and co-created §by the pilot education programme but sit amongst the 'archive' media and objects; like a CERN charity shop

So the archive sits amongst the 'education' stuff, both could be used or ignored.

### Cultural Probes
Mark talked about making cultural probes; little critical kits that foster questioning and dialogues: Hands on Tools for science ethnographers and proto scientists.

We've put together some classic STEM kits/ideas and started to think what dialogues and questions they might bring up. These could be presented as like a science studies buffet or the CERN charity shop: participants play with kits or make assemblages of kits and objects and a media clip or their own youtube selections

### Quantica Archive screens 

Tablets with media from Quantica artists research process

### CERN charity shop

Objects collected from CERN (maybe UoL also) that can be played with

Soft RPi cameras like [FOMOCam](http://fomocam.co.uk/) for audience to carry around or 360 camera versions in middle of workshop tables a bit lik in [critical-kits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PEeaHD4woU)
Records the dialogues we generate 

#### Difficult Questions
 * Why isnt the world flat? 
 * What is fake news and what is correlation, abductive and inductive reasoning? 
 * Can we access the invisible? 
 * Does information get destroyed? When I delete something on my phone what happens to this information? What is information anyway?
